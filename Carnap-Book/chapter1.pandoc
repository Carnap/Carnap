#Chapter 1: The Subject Matter of Logic
##Arguments and Reasoning

In this class, we are going to learn about reasoning. 

What is reasoning? 

*Reasoning is giving reasons for beliefs.*

When a lawyer approaches a jury and says 

> You must find my client innocent, and here's why...

that lawyer is giving reasons for beliefs. When an engineer says 

> If we follow these construction plans, the bridge we build will fall down,
> and here's why...

the engineer is giving reasons for beliefs. When a politician
says 

> I think the death penalty is barbaric, and here's why...

the politician is giving reasons for beliefs.

Reasoning, like the air we breathe, can be found anywhere that we find human
beings. Like the air, reasoning is often invisible to us until we focus our
attention on it. Once we do focus our attention on this pervasive activity, we
may become curious about it. What makes something a piece of reasoning? 

What all the examples above seem to have in common is a certain *structure*.
The structure involves, first, proposing a belief. The lawyer proposes that the
client is innocent. The engineer proposes that the bridge is structurally
unsound. The politician proposes that the death penalty is barbaric. The
structure then requires the proposer to support their belief. So some evidence
is given for adopting the belief. In each case above that is what we left out,
as "...". 

If we are to begin to study the nature of reasoning, we will need to find some
words for these parts of reasoning. So let us call the belief proposed
a **conclusion** and let us call the evidence for accepting the conclusion some
**premises**. We can call the whole unit of reasoning, the premises and
conclusion taken together, an **argument**.

Here are some examples of arguments

> My house is quite safe from earthquakes, since it is located far from any
> major fault lines.

> There are no cottonmouths around here---cottonmouths are the same as water
> moccasins, and water moccasins can be found only in southeast Kansas.

> My client is innocent by reason of insanity, since he ate a very bad diet in
> the months leading up to the shooting, and such a diet can cause a person to
> become unable to control themselves.

> There's no fastest motion, because any motion can be made faster by applying
> more force.

It is common practice among those who study arguments to write an argument with
the premises in a list, above the conclusion, like so:

> | 1. <span class="premise">My house is far from fault lines.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">My house is safe from earthquakes.</span>

> | 1. <span class="premise"> Cottonmouths are water moccasins.</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise"> Water moccasins can be found only in Southeast Kansas.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion"> There are no cottonmouths outside of Southeast Kansas.</span>

> | 1. <span class="premise">Any motion can be made faster.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion"> There's no fastest motion</span>


> | 1. <span class="premise">My Client ate a bad diet.</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">A bad diet can cause a lack of self-control.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion"> My client is innocent by reason of insanity.</span>


This allows us to conveniently see the structure of the arguments.

##Good and Bad Arguments

Not all of the arguments above are entirely foolproof. For example, a bad diet
might cause a lack of self-control without causing enough lack of self-control
to merit a finding of innocent by reasoning by insanity. And some arguments are
downright bad; politicians often say misleading things in an attempt to elicit
beliefs among their constituents. Engineers make mistakes. Lawyers sometimes
persuade a jury to believe one thing, when they really ought to believe
another. 

When arguments are bad like this, it is not always because they are not
persuasive. Often, people are persuaded by arguments that aren't very good. For
example, it is not uncommon to hear people say that because they've had
a loosing streak in some game of chance, they are more likely to win in the
future. But having a losing streak has no effect on your future chances of
winning, even though people tend to feel like it does, perhaps because they
feel like they *deserve* to win, after losing for a while. In other cases, bad
arguments may be decorated with emotionally loaded or smart-sounding language,
in order to cause the audience to *feel* like the conclusion is true. 

What we want to know is not which arguments *feel* like they lead us to the
truth.[^1] We want to know which arguments *actually do* lead us to the truth.
From this point of view, neither our ordinary habits of reasoning, nor the
emotional impact of an argument (whether it seems intimidatingly smart or
heartwrenchingly moving) count for anything at all. We want to know *when* an
argument really gives a good reason to believe. If we knew this, we could be
better voting citizens, better jury members, and better managers of engineering
projects, amongst other things. We could also be better lawyers, politicians,
and engineers, insofar as we could try to craft arguments that give our
audiences *good* reasons to believe.

[^1]:: Which is not to say that this is not an interesting question. But it is
a question for a psychology or English composition class, not for a logic
class. 

In some cases, finding out whether an argument gives us good reason to believe
something might require doing careful research. We might ask a geologist, for
example, whether the house really *is* far from faultlines. If it's next to
a giant fault, then you shouldn't listen to someone who says that it is safe
because it is far from faults. But in some cases, knowing the facts is not
enough. We may be sure about the truth of all the premises of an argument, but
remain unsure about whether the argument supports its conclusion.

For example, consider these two arguments:


> | 1. <span class="premise">Nine out of ten stop and frisk subjects are not charged with a crime.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">NYC Police are unreliable judges of whether someone has committed a crime.</span>

> | 1. <span class="premise">Unless soil is deep and sandy, it is not suitable for carrots.</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">Soil is either suitable for carrots or tomatoes, but not both.</span>
> |  <span class="conclusion">Soil suitable for tomatoes is not both deep and sandy.</span>


It is far from immediately obvious, but the first argument does not give reason
to believe its conclusion. That is in spite of the fact that we may have little
doubt about the first premise. If we consider the second argument, we'll also
find ourselves unsure about the conclusion. If a master gardener tells us that
the first two premises are true and a gardener of unknown skill remarks to us
"Ah, and so soil suitable for tomatoes is not both deep and sandy", we may be
quite confident of the premises, but unsure of whether they support the
conclusion being drawn.

The concern of logic is not to answer questions like whether houses are far
from fault lines, or whether the same soil can support both carrots and
tomatoes. Instead, logic aims to tell us which arguments describe a real
*connection* between premises and conclusion, and which arguments merely appear
to do so. 

##Validity

When an argument fails to lead us to the truth, it is because the premises are
true and the conclusion false. The arguments we are after are the ones that
cannot fail to lead us to the truth in this way. So we are after arguments in
which it is impossible for the premises to be true while the conclusion is at
the same time false. We call these arguments *deductively valid*

Deductively Valid

:   An argument is *deductively valid* if either

    1. It is impossible for its premises to be true and its conclusion false. 
    2. The truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. 

If we have a deductively valid argument for some conclusion, then as far as
logic goes, all is right with the world. All that remains to be shown is that
the premises are true. Once that is established, the conclusion is guaranteed.
This is a fairly high standard. For example, consider the following argument
pair:


> | 1. <span class="premise">If the mouse isn't in the trap, the cat ate it.</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">The mouse is not in the trap.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">The cat ate the mouse. </span>



> | 1. <span class="premise">If the mouse isn't in the trap, the cat ate it. </span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">The mouse is not in the trap.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">The mouse is dead. </span>


The first argument is deductively valid. The second is not---while the premises
make the conclusion very likely, it is still possible for them to be true and
the conclusion false. This might happen if, for example, the cat ate the mouse
in one bite and then coughed it up fully intact a moment later. 

Once we begin to think about deductive validity, we may notice something
interesting. The cat/trap argument is valid, but so is this one:


> | 1. <span class="premise">If the moose isn't in the trap, the dinosaur ate it. </span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">The moose is not in the trap.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">The dinosaur ate the moose. </span>


and so is this one:


> | 1. <span class="premise">If the moose isn't an albino, the dinosaur ate it.</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">The moose is not an albino.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">The dinosaur ate the moose. </span>


If you were somehow to find out that the premises of the latter argument were
true, even if you did not know anything about albino moose and dinosaurs, you
could still responsibly infer that the dinosaur must have eaten the moose. What
this suggests is that the validity of the argument sketched here does not
depend on the specific content of the premises. Rather, since we could vary the
content of the premises without changing the validity of the argument, the
validity of this argument must depend on something that all three arguments
have in common, something that we did not vary. We call this thing the *logical
form* of the argument. 

Logical Form

:   *Logical form* is what similarly structured arguments have in common.

One way of depicting the form of the three arguments above is as follows:


> | <span class="premise">If $P$, then $Q$. </span>
> | <span class="premise">$P$.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">$Q$.</span>


This logical form is called *modus ponens*. The result of replacing the letters
$P$ and $Q$ with actual assertions will be a deductively valid argument.

When the deductive validity of an argument depends only on the argument's
logical form, we say that the argument is *formally valid*.

Formally Valid

:   An argument is *formally valid* if 

    1. It is deductively valid because of its logical form.
    2. Every argument with the same logical form is deductively valid.

The basic idea of formal logic is to try to find and classify all of the
logical forms that make arguments deductively valid. If we could do this, then
we would have a good test for the deductive validity of arguments: we could
just figure out their logical forms, and then check the form against our
classification.

#Formal Languages
 
##Ambiguity
 
The project of classifying arguments by their logical form is simple enough.
But if we try to push it very far, we will meet a serious challenge. Here is an
example. The following argument  looks quite compelling.

> | 1. <span class="premise">A silver medal is better than a bronze medal.</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">A gold medal is better than a silver medal.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">A gold medal is better than a bronze medal. </span>

Moreover, it seems to be good because of its form. For example, the argument

> | 1. <span class="premise">A field goal is better than a safety.</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">A touchdown is better than a field goal.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">A touchdown is better than a safety. </span>

is deductively valid as well. This might lead us to believe that the following
logical form confers validity on the arguments that have it:

> | 1. <span class="premise">$B$ is better than $C$.</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">$A$ is better than $B$.</span> 
> | <span class="conclusion">$A$ is better than $C$. </span>

 But what about this argument?

> | 1. <span class="premise">Nothing is better than world peace.</span>
> | 2. <span class="premise">Cold pizza is better than nothing.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">Cold pizza is better than world peace. </span>

The conclusion is certainly false, but the premises are plausibly true. What is
going on here?

The trouble is that English (and indeed all natural languages) contains many
*ambiguous* sentences.

Ambiguous

:   An ambiguous sentence is a sentence that has more than one possible meaning.

And logical form is determined not by the sentences that make up our arguments,
but by their *meanings*. When the sentences that make up an argument have more
than one meaning, the argument can have more than one logical form. And if an
argument has more than one logical form, then the answer to the question "is it
formally valid?" will generally be "it depends". This is an unsatisfying state
of affairs.

Here are some examples of arguments whose validity depends on how we interpret
ambiguous sentences. It is a good exercise to try to spot how one reading makes
the argument deductively valid and the other reading does not.

> | 1. <span class="premise">Salvatore brought a hat from Italy.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">Salvatore has been to Italy.</span>

> | 1. <span class="premise">Bill and Barb are married.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">Bill is Barb's husband.</span>

> | 1. <span class="premise">Charlotte's Web is a children's novel about a pig named Wilbur who is saved from being slaughtered by an intelligent spider named Charlotte. </span>
> | <span class="conclusion">In C.W., Charlotte saves Wilbur.</span>

> | 1. <span class="premise">John saw the man on the mountain with a telescope.</span>
> | <span class="conclusion">The man on the mountain has a telescope.</span>

If we are to get very far with formal logic, we will need to have a way of
dealing with ambiguity. The key idea here come from
a mathematician-philosopher named Gottlob Frege. Frege's idea was this.
Because natural languages contain ambiguous sentences, we need a special
artificial language for the purpose of studying logical consequence. Such
a language should be free of ambiguity. Each sentence should have exactly one
meaning, and exactly one logical form. If we could devise such a language, then
we could say clearly and systematically which arguments are formally valid.
Such a language is called a *formal* language.

In order to design an unambiguous formal language language, we need to get some
grip on the sources of ambiguity in natural language. That way, we can make
sure to prevent those sources from including ambiguity in our formal language.
What are the sources of ambiguity? Let's consider another example.

>   "I shot an elephant in my pajamas"[^2] 

[^2]:: See [The Marx Brothers Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfN_gcjGoJo).

What makes this sentence ambiguous is that it is not clear which words are
meant to modify which other words. The sentence might be read in one of two
ways, either as:

```{.diagram .snip}
toText :: String -> Diagram SVG
toText s = let ln = fromIntegral (length s) in
    text s <> rect (ln * 7/10) 1 # lc white # fc white
```



```diagram

        [ Node (toText "I") []
        , Node (toText "shot an elephant in my pajamas") 
            [ Node (toText "shot an elephant") 
                [ Node (toText "shot") []
                , Node (toText "an elephant") []
                ]
            , Node (toText "in my pajamas") []
            ]
        ]

exampleSymmTreeWithDs =
  renderTree id (~~)
  (symmLayout' (with & slWidth  .~ fromMaybe (0,0) . extentX
                     & slHeight .~ fromMaybe (0,0) . extentY
                     & slHSep    .~ 4
                     & slVSep    .~ 4)
     tD)
  # centerXY # pad 1.1 <> rect 40 25
```

Or alternatively, as

```diagram
exampleSymmTreeWithDs

import Data.Tree
import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)
import Diagrams.TwoD.Layout.Tree

tD = Node (toText "I shot an elephant in my pajamas") 
        [ Node (toText "I") []
        , Node (toText "shot an elephant in my pajamas") 
            [ Node (toText "shot") []
            , Node (toText "an elephant in my pajamas") 
                [ Node (toText "an elephant") []
                , Node (toText "in my pajamas") []
                ]
            ]

        ]

exampleSymmTreeWithDs = 
  renderTree id (~~)
  (symmLayout' (with & slWidth  .~ fromMaybe (0,0) . extentX
                     & slHeight .~ fromMaybe (0,0) . extentY
                     & slHSep    .~ 4
                     & slVSep    .~ 4)
     tD)
  # centerXY # pad 1.1 <> rect 40 25
``` 

The meaning of the sentence depends on how we read it. Of course, we can
eliminate the ambiguity by specifying which of the trees above we intend. But
this is pretty awkward. A better way to eliminate the ambiguity is to use
*parentheses* to stick together the units that are supposed to go
together---the units that we do not unpack until further down the tree. 

So we might express the first reading of the sentence by writing "I ((shot an
elephant) in my pajamas)", and the second by writing "I (shot (an elephant in
my pajamas))".[^3]

[^3]:: This idea may seem unfamiliar, but it is actually something
that you have been doing for a long time. If you know the difference between
"$(2 + 2) \times 2$" and "$2 + (2 \times 2)$" then you know how to disambiguate
language by using parentheses.

Our formal language will make use of parentheses for the same purpose.

##Our Formal Language

It will pay to start simple. So we will begin by building our formal language
out of just two types of ingredients: *assertions*, and *connectives*.
Assertions are simple true or false statements of fact. For example "The atomic
number of gold is 79" is an assertion. So is "The atomic number of gold is 32",
and "the air conditioner is noisy". Some things that are not assertions are "Do
your homework!" and "Who's the number one marching band drummer of all time?".
Connectives are expressions that can be used to combine assertions into complex
assertions. Some examples of connectives are "and", "or" "if ...
then ...", and "if and only if". We can use them to stick
together sentences like this:

1. If <span style="color: blue;"> I go to work </span> then <span
   style="color:red"> I will pass by Detroit</span>.
2. If <span style="color: blue;">I dance a jig</span> then <span
   style="color:red;">I will amuse onlookers</span>.
3. <span style="color: blue;">There's a storm outside</span> and <span
   style="color: red;">hail is beginning to come down</span>.
4. <span style="color: blue;">You're in</span> or <span
   style="color:red;">you're out</span>.

Another connective is "it is not the case that". This connective is a bit odd,
because it does not serve to connect two sentences. But it is, nevertheless,
useful for forming new assertions out of old ones. For example, we can take
"there's a cat on the roof", and get "It's not the case that there's a cat on
the roof".

Even with this small set of ingredients, however, ambiguity is possible. Consider:

>   "Jack R. was in town and the night watchman saw him or nobody saw Jack R."

Does this sentence imply that Jack R. was in town? It depends on which of the
following two ways we read it:

(@) "(Jack R. was in town and the night watchman saw him) or nobody saw Jack R."
(@) "Jack R. was in town and (the night watchman saw him or nobody saw Jack R.)"

The first doesn't imply that Jack R. was in town. The second does. If we are to
avoid this kind of unclarity, we are also going to need to include parentheses
in our language, in order to make sure that the structure of each assertion of
our language has exactly one clear meaning.

The last consideration is efficiency. We want to be able to write down our
sentences quickly, and to see their structure at a glance. So it will be
helpful to be rather minimalistic about what we use to represent the assertions
and connectives of our language. 

Let us use, to represent assertions in our language, single capital letters
$P,Q, R,..., Z$. If we need more, let's make them by adding a little subscript
to letters that we already have: $P_1, P_2,...$. That way, we will have as many
assertion letters as we need. Let's also abbreviate the connectives of our
language. Let's use just the five connectives from before, and write

1. "$\land$" for "and"
2. "$\lor$" for "or"
3. "$\rightarrow$" for "if ... then ..."
4. "$\leftrightarrow$" for "if and only if"
5. "$\neg$" for "it is not the case that"

This tells us what the ingredients in our language will be: assertion letters,
connective symbols, and parentheses. But how should we put them together? Here,
we need to be careful. It must be clear how to extract the structure of
a sentence from how we write it. In order to be sure that this is possible, we
must adhere to the following two rules in building sentences:

1. Every sentence letter "$P, Q, R, ..., Z, P_1, Q_1, R_1, ..., Z_1, P_2,...$"
   is a grammatical assertion.
2. We may build a grammatical assertion:
    a.  by taking two grammatical assertions we already have, putting an
        $\land,\lor,\rightarrow$ or $\leftrightarrow$ between, and wrapping the
        result in parentheses;

        *For example, $(P\land R)$ is a grammatical assertion.*

    b.  by taking one grammatical assertions we already have, and putting
        a $\neg$ in front.

        *For example, $\neg P$ is a grammatical assertion, as is $\neg (P\land R)$.
        Notice that adding $\neg$ does not require us to add new parentheses.*

Every grammatical assertion in our language must be constructed according to
these two rules. *No other assertions will count as grammatical.*[^4] We
call those assertions which can be built by merely repeatedly applying the two
rules above *sentences in official notation*.

[^4]:: we will eventually allow for some abbreviations---but for an abbreviated
sentence to be grammatical will just mean that it is an abbreviation of
a sentence constructed according to the two rules above

Official Notation

:   A sentence is in official notation when it is built by merely repeatedly
    applying rules one and two above.

We can, notice, easily recover the tree that should be associated with
a sentence by thinking about the order in which that sentence must have been
created. For example, consider the sentence $((P\lor Q)\lor R)$. This must have
been built by first taking a $P$ and $Q$ and sticking them together, then
taking an $R$ and sticking that on. So it has the tree: 

```diagram
exampleSymmTreeWithDs

import Data.Tree
import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)
import Diagrams.TwoD.Layout.Tree

tD = Node (toText "((P ∨ Q) ∨ R)") 
        [ Node (toText "(P ∨ Q)") 
            [ Node (toText "P") []
            , Node (toText "Q") []
            ]
        , Node (toText "R") []
        ]

exampleSymmTreeWithDs =
  renderTree id (~~)
  (symmLayout' (with & slWidth  .~ fromMaybe (0,0) . extentX
                     & slHeight .~ fromMaybe (0,0) . extentY
                     & slHSep    .~ 4
                     & slVSep    .~ 4)
     tD)
  # centerXY # pad 1.1 <> rect 40 25
```

In general we can recover the tree of a sentence by finding the last connective
which was added, breaking it up into the one or two sentences that it was made
out of, and repeating. To take another example: in the sentence $(((P\lor
Q)\lor R)\rightarrow S)$, the connective $\rightarrow$ must have been added
last (since it is wrapped in only one set of parentheses). So we can break the
sentence up as 

```diagram
exampleSymmTreeWithDs

import Data.Tree
import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)
import Diagrams.TwoD.Layout.Tree

tD = Node (toText "((P ∨ Q) ∨ R)→ S") 
        [ Node (toText "((P ∨ Q) ∨ R)") []
        , Node (toText "S") []
        ]

exampleSymmTreeWithDs =
  renderTree id (~~)
  (symmLayout' (with & slWidth  .~ fromMaybe (0,0) . extentX
                     & slHeight .~ fromMaybe (0,0) . extentY
                     & slHSep    .~ 4
                     & slVSep    .~ 4)
     tD)
  # centerXY # pad 1.1 <> rect 40 25
```

In $(((P\lor Q)\lor R)$, the $\lor$ must have been added last (since it is
wrapped only once), so we can break as:

```diagram
exampleSymmTreeWithDs

import Data.Tree
import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)
import Diagrams.TwoD.Layout.Tree

tD = Node (toText "((P ∨ Q) ∨ R)→ S") 
        [ Node (toText "((P ∨ Q) ∨ R)") 
            [ Node (toText "(P ∨ Q)") []
            , Node (toText "R") []
            ]
        , Node (toText "S") []
        ]

exampleSymmTreeWithDs =
  renderTree id (~~)
  (symmLayout' (with & slWidth  .~ fromMaybe (0,0) . extentX
                     & slHeight .~ fromMaybe (0,0) . extentY
                     & slHSep    .~ 4
                     & slVSep    .~ 4)
     tD)
  # centerXY # pad 1.1 <> rect 40 25
```

Finally, in $(P \lor Q)$, $\lor$ was obviously added last. So we have:

```diagram
exampleSymmTreeWithDs

import Data.Tree
import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)
import Diagrams.TwoD.Layout.Tree

tD = Node (toText "((P ∨ Q) ∨ R)→ S") 
        [ Node (toText "((P ∨ Q) ∨ R)") 
            [ Node (toText "(P ∨ Q)") 
                [ Node (toText "P") []
                , Node (toText "Q") []
                ]
            , Node (toText "R") []
            ]
        , Node (toText "S") []
        ]

exampleSymmTreeWithDs =
  renderTree id (~~)
  (symmLayout' (with & slWidth  .~ fromMaybe (0,0) . extentX
                     & slHeight .~ fromMaybe (0,0) . extentY
                     & slHSep    .~ 4
                     & slVSep    .~ 4)
     tD)
  # centerXY # pad 1.1 <> rect 40 25
```

We call the last connective to be added the *main connective* of the assertion.

Main Connective

:   The *main connective of a sentence in official notation* is the last
    connective to be added in the process of building that sentence up.

Sentences in official notation are very clear---it is easy to find their
structure. They can sometimes seem a bit cluttered, though. For example, do we
really need the outer parentheses in the sentence "$(P\land Q)$"? Would
"$P\land Q$" be any less clear? The answer is obviously no. So, next week, we
will introduce some simplification rules---kind of like PEMDAS---that will let
us know when we can afford to leave out the extra parentheses.

#Exercises

To practice some of these concepts, try the following exercises: what you need
to do is enter the *main connective* of the highlighted sentence. To do this,
type in the main connective and then press return (don't press the submit
button until you're done with the problem---when you are, the display will say
"success!"). 

Once you've entered that connective, the sentence will be broken down into its
parts---keep going, entering the main connective for each highlighted
sentence.

When you're done, and the sentence has been completely broken down, so that
the display reads "success!", press the submit button to save your work.
You'll then be able to see the completed problem in your user page.

The way to type in the different connectives is given in this table:

 Connective           Keyboard Shorthand 
------------         --------------------
  $\land$            /\\
  $\lor$             \\/
  $\rightarrow$      -> 
  $\leftrightarrow$  <->
  $\neg$             ~

##Problem Set 1

Here's your first set of problems:

```{.SynChecker .Match}
1.1   P /\ Q
1.2   Q \/ R
1.3   P /\ (R -> Q)
1.4   R <-> (S \/ ~P)
1.5   (P /\ R) <-> (P \/ (Q /\ ~S))
1.6   (R -> S) \/ (P -> Q)
1.7   (Q -> (R -> S)) -> ((P -> Q)->(P -> R))
1.8   (R \/ S) -> (P<-> ~Q\/R)
1.9   (P /\ (P /\ (P /\ (P /\ P))))
1.10  (R<->S) \/ (P/\ -Q) \/ (-R /\ S)
```
