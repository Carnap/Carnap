    <h2> Background

    <p> Carnap is a free and open software framework written in #
        <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell
        \ for teaching and studying formal logic.

    <p> Carnap powers the interactive online component of Kansas State University's #
        <i>PHILO110: Introduction to Formal Logic
        \ and #
        <i>PHILO320: Introduction to Symbolic Logic I
        \ and also supports logic teaching at the University of Birmingham.

    <p> If you're a student in a course that uses Carnap, please follow the
        \ links at the top of the page to log in and to access course
        \ materials.

    <p> If you're just curious about Carnap, you can find some general
        \ information on our #
        <a href=@{InfoR}>about
        \ page. If you're interested in the project, and would like to use
        \ Carnap in a class you're teaching, or get involved in some other way,
        \ please feel free to #
